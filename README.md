This is a simple recipes app for the porpose of learning:
* django.
* graphql.
* React?, Vue?, Elm? (I have not decided what to use on front-end yet).
* Testing all of it.
* Using dokcer/docker-compose for dev, test and production environments.
* Puting a django aplication on production.

The app ideia comes from: [Want to build something fun? Hereâ€™s a list of sample web app ideas](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/want-to-build-something-fun-heres-a-list-of-sample-web-app-ideas-b991bce0ed9a).

*By the medium idea description:*
* Enter a name and a description with the steps
* Have pictures
* Have some ranking for difficulty and quality
* Add the time needed
* Have different steps with a picture for each
* Store them somewhere
